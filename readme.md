# Project euler

> A personal project of mine, I will work on this occasionally

The [project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net) is a community project, dedicated to solve a series of mathematical and computational problems.

This is my personal attempt to solve this problems, although I am sure I will not solve most of them, I will do as much as them as I possibly can.

## Toolset

I'll be using python, vscode, by browser, and of course my brain, no AI btw
